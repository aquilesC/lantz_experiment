# Sensors used in the experiment. They have to be grouped by the device to which they are connected. The name does need
# to be unique only within a device, not overall. For example, you can see that there are two photodiodes with the same
# name, but one connected to the NI-DAQ and one to the oscilloscope.

# NI card. Every sensor has to specify also a port, description, units, etc.
NI-DAQ:
  Photodiode 1:
    port: 1
    type: analog
    description: Forward Intensity
    calibration:
      units: V # Target units, starting from volts. The calibration thus would be: sensor_value (true units) = slope*volts+offset
      slope: 1
      offset: 0
    limits:
      min: -10.0V
      max: 10V
  Photodiode 2:
    port: 1
    type: analog
    description: Forward Intensity
    calibration:
      units: V # Target units, starting from volts. The calibration thus would be: device_value (true units) = slope*volts+offset
      slope: 1
      offset: 0
    limits:
      min: -10.0V
      max: 10V

# When the device is connected to the serial or USB ports, specifying which properties are sensors make it easier to
# setup a GUI or to monitor values that are provided by the device itself. No need to write them ALL down, just the ones
# relevants for the experiment.
#TSL-710:
#  Wavelength:
#    property: wavelength
#  Power:
#    property: powermW

## There can be another ADQ device, such as an oscilloscope
#oscilloscope:
#  Photodiode 1:
#    port: 1
#    type: analog
#    description: Photodiode connected to oscilloscope
